# PDB GAN

**PDB GAN** is a collection of PDB 3-dimensional images to be used for training GANs (*Generative Adversarial Network*).
## Dataset

The datasets consist of images (front, side, and top views) of all referenced protein entries from [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/). The images themselves are taken from [EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/).
Two formats of the dataset are available based on the size (in pixels: 28x28 and 64x64) of the images, with three different modes (binary, gray, and RGB).

Visualization of a few entries in the dataset in RGB format with 28x28 arrays for each entry:
